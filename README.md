Node.js (v18 or higher)
npm or yarn
## Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/marcelo-ferreira8/country-info-app.git
cd country-info-app
2. Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the backend folder and install the necessary dependencies:
cd backend
npm install
3. Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the frontend folder and install the necessary dependencies:
cd frontend
npm install

4. Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the backend directory for storing your environment variables, like so:

For Backend:
PORT=
NAGER_API_URL=
COUNTRIES_NOW_API_URL=

Check .env.example


5. Run Backend Server
From the backend directory, run the backend server using the following command:
npm run dev
The backend will be available at http://localhost:PORT.

6. Run Frontend Server
From the frontend directory, start the Next.js development server:
npm run dev
The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

7. Verify the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
The main page will list available countries, and when clicking on a country, it will display detailed information, including the countryâ€™s flag, borders, and population chart.

## API Endpoints
1. Get Available Countries
Endpoint: GET /api/getAvailableCountries
Description: Returns a list of available countries.
2. Get Country Info
Endpoint: GET /api/getCountryInfo/:code

### Troubleshooting
CORS Issues: Make sure the backend has CORS enabled, especially if the frontend and backend are on different ports.
Install cors in the backend:
npm install cors
Then, configure it in index.ts:
import cors from "cors";
app.use(cors());
Missing Dependencies: If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, run npm install in both the backend and frontend directories.
